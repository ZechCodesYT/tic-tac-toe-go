# Zech's First Go Program!

This was my attempt to learn Go while coding Tic-Tac-Toe! Streamed live on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/fo9O6uKWprM)! I think it was a great success!

## Running

Clone the repo and in your terminal run
```sh
go run .
```
You'll need to make sure you have Go installed before you do, learn how to do that [here](https://go.dev/learn/).
